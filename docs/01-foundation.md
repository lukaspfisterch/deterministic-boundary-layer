# Foundation – Motivation & Scope

## 1. Problem

Non-deterministic systems - especially LLMs, reinforcement agents, and adaptive orchestration layers -  
cannot guarantee identical outcomes for identical inputs.  
This breaks traditional assumptions of traceability and compliance.

## 2. Consequence

Without a deterministic wrapper:
- Risk models collapse (no bounded behavior).
- Post-event analysis lacks causal continuity.
- Legal or audit obligations cannot be fulfilled.

## 3. Position of DBL

DBL defines a **deterministic perimeter**:
- All inputs pass through a *policy-controlled gateway*.
- Every decision point is *logged, signed, and timestamped*.
- Execution contexts are *segregated and sealed*.

## 4. Outcome

The result is not a deterministic model —  
but a **deterministic operational footprint**.

This footprint enables reproducibility, evidence trails, and safe integration into regulated infrastructures.
